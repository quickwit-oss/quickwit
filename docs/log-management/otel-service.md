Quickwit natively supports the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/otlp/) and provides a gRPC endpoint to receive spans from an OpenTelemetry collector. This endpoint is enabled by default.

When enabled, Quickwit will start the gRPC service ready to receive logs from an OpenTelemetry collector. The logs are indexed in the `otel-logs-v0_7` index by default, and this index will be automatically created if not present. The index doc mapping is described in the next [section](#trace-and-span-data-model).

If for any reason, you want to disable this endpoint, you can:
- Set the `QW_ENABLE_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable to `false` when starting Quickwit.
- Or [configure the node config](/docs/configuration/node-config.md) by setting the indexer setting `enable_otlp_endpoint` to `false`.

```yaml title=node-config.yaml
# ... Indexer configuration ...
indexer:
    enable_otlp_endpoint: false
```

## Sending logs in your own index

You can send logs in the index of your choice by setting the header `qw-otel-logs-index` of your gRPC request to the targeted index ID.


## OpenTelemetry logs data model

Quickwit sends OpenTelemetry logs into the `otel-logs-v0_7` index by default which is automatically created if you enable the OpenTelemetry service.
The doc mapping of this index described below is derived from the [OpenTelemetry logs data model](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/logs/data-model/).

```yaml

index_id: otel-logs-v0_7

## UI Integration

Currently, Quickwit provides a simplistic UI to get basic information from the cluster, indexes and search documents.
If a simple UI is not sufficient for you and you need additional features, Grafana and Elasticsearch query API support are planned for Q2 2023, stay tuned!

You can also send traces to Quickwit that you can visualize in Jaeger UI, as explained in the following [tutorial](../distributed-tracing/send-traces/using-otel-sdk-python.md).


## Known limitations

There are a few limitations on the log management setup in Quickwit 0.9:
- The ingest API does not provide High-Durability. This will be fixed in 0.10.
- OTLP HTTP is only available with the Binary Protobuf Encoding. OTLP HTTP with JSON encoding is not planned yet, but this can be easily fixed in the next version. Please open an issue if you need this feature.

If you are interested in new features or discover other limitations, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit).
